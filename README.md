  &nbsp;Hello there! :wave:&nbsp;

<br>

I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Singapore exploring the realm of human behaviour within online social platforms, and their manifestations in our day-to-day lives. My current research delves into the intricate dynamics of news consumption and the consequent emotional or attitudinal repercussions among partisan audience in online social platforms, using agent-based models as my primary tool. I have been involved in various projects that employ computational methods to better understand, analyze and emulate human mannerisms, in both online and offline environments. By leveraging computational models, I aspire to contribute to the development of strategies and interventions that promote positive social interactions and enhance our understanding of the intricate relationships between individuals and their virtual communities.
